I was born in 1999 in Karachi, Pakistan and raised in a tightly-knit, middle class family. From an early age, I was fascinated by computer technology, for I opened eyes in a world where personal computing had already permeated the fabric of society.

Eventually, I grew up and finished my elementary and secondary education, never getting bored of my fascination for computers. We were amongst the early majority in Pakistan when my father bought an amazing machine into our home in 2004 called the 'Personal Computer' and from then on, things changed. Opening up my Desktop Computer and tinkering around with its components was one of my childhood fascinations, coupled with sketching futuristic cars and reading and writing fiction.

Throughout my ups and downs growing up, books and computers never left my side, and they continue to bolster me to date. Through the whims of fate, I ended up studying Business for my Bachelor's education, but my fascination for tech got the better of me. I found myself working for a technology startup in 2020 and the rest is history.

What started as a way to redeem my childhood fascination turned into a career most call 'Product Management'. Seeing my eagerness to contribute and my business education, I was given a chance to work as the first product manager at a rapidly growing startup and what followed was a period characterized by immense growth.

Learning from the ground-up using books and online resources proved to be beneficial for me since I could learn from the best and experiment without biases or restrictions. I learnt a lot, and messed up a lot as well - I was a terrible Product Manager for my first product and I duly thank the team for their patience while I learnt.

While I have just started on my journey to become a better PM, I would like to share my learnings with the world to learn and grow together. Apart from Product Management, I am also keenly interested in Anthropology, Human Nature, Neurology, and Philosophy. In fact, the best way to know about me is to refer to my reading list.
