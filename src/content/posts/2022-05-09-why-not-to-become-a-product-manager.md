description: There's an increasingly large amount of literature on why you
  should become a Product Manager, but I feel like a lot of people are being
  misguided about the role by only exposing them to the upside of being a PM,
  without giving a realistic assessment of the downsides of the job. The purpose
  for writing this is to give you a complete picture of the downside so you can
  take that into account when deciding on whether to pursue a career in Product
  Management or not. The idea for writing this came up when a normal
  synchronization meeting at work with another PM escalated into the reasons why
  our jobs are so difficult.

There's an increasingly large amount of literature on why you should become a Product Manager, but I feel like a lot of people are being misguided about the role by only exposing them to the upside of being a PM, without giving a realistic assessment of the downsides of the job. The purpose for writing this is to give you a complete picture of the downside so you can take that into account when deciding on whether to pursue a career in Product Management or not. The idea for writing this came up when a normal synchronization meeting at work with another PM escalated into the reasons why our jobs are so difficult.

### All the responsibility that comes from accountability without the authority.

When a PM fails, the results can be devastating. You need to have a very good reason for why your product failed, since you are being trusted with the responsibility to drive the product's success, regardless of the fact that there are countless factors responsible for the failure of the Product.

However, you do not have the authority that comes with such high accountability in this role, specifically early in your career. You have to convince and motivate the stakeholders to buy-in on your vision to build a feature or product. Additionally, you have to absolutely be on good terms with your supervisor, since your performance appraisal can usually be based on vague terms.

### Low demand for Product Managers compared to other tech roles

A quick look at any recruitment portal will give you a clear picture into why I claim the above statement. Usually, a Product Manager is working with more than one Engineer, Designer, Data, Customer Service, or Operations person. This makes the demand for the role not scale as fast as other team members when teams grow. In good economic times, this effect might get veiled by the sheer number of openings available, but in bad times, the Product Manager is the easiest person to get rid of in the squad, since decision making and coordination can be handled by senior management in times of austerity.

Additionally, technology startups, on average, hire Product Managers much later than specialized talent i.e. Engineers, Designers, and Data Engineers. The founders themselves act as a PM and usually do the job pretty well, which decreased the amount of companies that hire a PM.

### Depending on the circumstances, your team might not fancy you

Usually, when you are early in your career, you might be working with squad members and team members that are older than you or more experienced. They might resist to any directions from you in a bid to maintain their freedom and control. They might even complain that you are trying to tell them how to do their job when you are only trying to help them. This is all natural.

Additionally, when you are not contributing to the team in the form of tangible output, it might be perceived by some that you are unfairly reaping the rewards of the hard work of others and a free rider is not seen favorably. You have to prioritize good relationships with your team members, even if it means compromising on some things to achieve that. Additionally, you need to be actively working hard to match your team and try to influence through good example.

### You are replaceable and a lot of people want to become a PM

A lot of PM roles do not necessarily require a Computer Science degree. At first, I thought it was a good thing since I come from a Business educational background. However, I quickly realized that everyone around me could potentially move into my position without any prior context or relevant experience. I have been approached by countless colleagues from my college on 'How to break into Product' or 'How do I become a PM' since they think it is a cool job which requires being the 'CEO of the product', and largely I am writing this to address their myths.

Additionally, in every organization I have worked in, there are countless people aiming to shift into Product. I have seen people from Growth, Sales, Operations, Data, Engineering, and Design aiming to shift into Product, which makes it a competitive domain. It is also easier to pretend to be a Product Manager.

### You can't leverage your skills to freelance

A large part of your job requires generic, managerial skills such as decision making, prioritization, strategy, planning, project management, and communication. The reality is that a large part of your day will be spent in meetings, and you do not get the time to work on your technical skills compared to specialized roles.

On the other hand, Designers, Engineers, and Data Scientists can use their technical skills, which are brushed up during their day jobs. Therefore, regardless of how you are earning on base salary, it is very difficult to freelance as a PM and scale your earnings. The chicken and egg problem in most of the openings in Product is that the roles require anywhere between 3-7 years of experience and there aren't many entry level roles in Product to furnish that experience.

### **So wait, why are you a Product Manager?**

I absolutely love my job to the core - to the point where work feels like play. Having a keen sense of observation, I have noticed the upsides and downsides from my experience of being a PM, and seeing the increasing interest in the role, I felt it was my duty to share the whole picture.

The purpose of writing this article is to:

* Give people looking to switch a realistic view of becoming a PM and avoid them being disappointed.
* See behind the hype of Product Management and provide a wholistic picture.
* Articulate the problems and challenges one can expect as a PM.
* Instill empathy in other roles such as Engineering, Design, and Data for PMs.

I did not write this article to:

* Discourage people looking into becoming a PM.
* Spread negativity based out of speculation - I have made sure I speak from experience, and individual mileage may vary.
