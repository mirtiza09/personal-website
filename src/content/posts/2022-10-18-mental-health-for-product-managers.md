It wasn’t until I had worked in a remote environment over a prolonged period that I realized that my mental health might be in jeopardy. Today, I went out in the field to visit users after a long time due to logistical hurdles, and it was amazingly refreshing to step out and interact with people in-person. It was also an alarm bell for me to take my mental health more seriously, or my personal and work life would suffer. Below are some of the mental health challenges Product Managers might face, and how I have tried coping with them over time:

# Imposter Syndrome

You can’t help but feel the tight knot in your stomach when you doubt your product strategy or a product decision. While I have written about the right tools to make better decisions, the truth of the matter is that sometimes, we have to follow our gut instincts on product decisions and face the doubts, uncertainties, and criticisms that come with those decisions. In order to counter this feeling, I suggest you ensure that you have researched well on the rationale of your decisions and strategies in the form of data or customer feedback. In case that is not present, be comfortable in admitting that you do not know and be open to advice from other people.

If the source of your Imposter syndrome is a lack of a tangible skillset while working with a group of highly qualified technical people, I suggest you specialize in a niche such as Product Analyst or Product Designer by acquiring the specific hard skills required.

# Difficult Conversations

In a collaborative role, you will be at the center of a lot of ‘difficult conversations’. Whether it is about customer complaints, killing a product/feature, or performance issues of specific team members. If you are forced to contend with a lot of such conversations, I would suggest that you take a step back and empathize with the other parties but also be firm and confident. As a rule of thumb, I am starting to realize that a difficult conversation on time is much better than a downright uncomfortable conversation later on. So schedule those difficult conversations with your stakeholders — life is too short to worry about scenarios that may or may not happen.

# Loneliness

Working from home can be incredibly isolating and a detriment for your mental health. Work relationships and socialization can be a source of empowerment for many, and an absence of this might make you more lonely. For me, working on my home office desk on a long term basis results in a loss of productivity and fatigue, so I often go and visit my nearest library or coffee shop to work from there. Additionally, if you have a dedicated office in spite of remote working, or a hybrid work environment, I suggest you plan to visit it at least once a week to socialize with your peers. I am sure you will find the stresses of commuting to office once a week worth the sacrifice for the sake of your mental health.

While the solutions listed above are neither comprehensive nor exhaustive, I hope I have been able to contribute to an ever increasing literature on mental health, specially in remote working environments.
